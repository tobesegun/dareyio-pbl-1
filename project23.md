# PERSISTING DATA IN KUBERNETES
Create EKS cluster first before the below section
- Kubernetes supports many types of volumes. A Pod can use any number of volume types simultaneously. Ephemeral volume types have a lifetime of a pod, but persistent volumes exist beyond the lifetime of a pod. When a pod ceases to exist, Kubernetes destroys ephemeral volumes; however, Kubernetes does not destroy persistent volumes. For any kind of volume in a given pod, data is preserved across container restarts.

## awsElasticBlockStore
An awsElasticBlockStore volume mounts an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EBS volume into your pod. The contents of an EBS volume are persisted and the volume is only unmmounted when the pod crashes, or terminates. This means that an EBS volume can be pre-populated with data, and that data can be shared between pods.

## Step1
Lets see what it looks like for our Nginx pod to persist data using awsElasticBlockStore volume

```
sudo cat <<EOF | sudo tee ./nginx-pod.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    tier: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      volumes:
      - name: nginx-volume
        # This AWS EBS volume must already exist.
        awsElasticBlockStore:
          volumeID: "<volume id>"
          fsType: ext4
EOF
```
the volume section indicates the type of volume to be used to ensure persistence.

If you notice the config above carefully, you will realise that there is need to provide a volumeID before the deployment will work. Therefore, You must create an EBS volume by using aws ec2 create-volume command or the AWS console.

Before you create a volume, lets run the nginx deployment into kubernetes without a volume.

```
sudo cat <<EOF | sudo tee ./nginx-pod.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    tier: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF
```
## Step2
Verify that the pod is running
Check the logs of the pod
Exec into the pod and navigate to the nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/conf.d
Open the config files to see the default configuration

## Step3
Now that we have the pod running without a volume, Lets now create a volume from the AWS console.

In your AWS console, head over to the EC2 section and scroll down to the Elastic Block Storage menu.
Click on Volumes
At the top right, click on Create Volume
