    ![](imgs/nameservers.png)
- Ensure to tag all resources you create (Project, Environment, Name etc)

## Step 1: Setup a Virtual Private Cloud
![Reference image](imgs/archi.png)
- Create a VPC from the VPC Management Console use a large enough CIDR block (/16)
- Create subnets as shown in the diagram above
  ![](imgs/subnets.png)
  - For the public subnet, enable auto-assign IP by selecting the subnet (after you've created it) and clicking Actions button on the top right, then select Modify auto-assign IP settings and enable it
- Create a route table and associate it with the public subnets
  - Select the route table you created, click Actions on the top and click 'Edit Subnet associations'
  - Select the public subnets and click save
- Create a route table for the private subnets
  - Repeate the steps above
- Create an Internet Gateway, select it and click Actions the click Attach to VPC and attach it to the VPC you created
- Add a new route to your public subnet route table
  - Select the route table, click Actions and 'Edit routes'
  - For destination, enter 0.0.0.0/0
  - For target, select Internet Gateway and click the Internet Gateway you created
  - Click Save
- Create a NAT Gateway for your private subnets (create one in each public subnet)
- Allocate three Elastic IPs and attach one of them to the NAT Gateway
- Add a new route to your private route table with destination as 0.0.0.0/0 and target as the NAT Gateway you created
  ![](imgs/privatertb.png)
  ![](imgs/route-table.png)
- Create a security group for:
  - Nginx servers: Access to nginx servers should only be from the Application Load Balancer
  - Bastion servers: Access to bastion servers should only be from the IPs of your workstation
  - Application Load Balancer: ALB should be open to the internet
  - Webservers: Webservers should only be accessible from the Nginx servers
  - Data Layer: This comprises the RDS and EFS servers. Access to RDS should only be from Webservers, while Nginx and Webservers can have access to EFS

    Repeat the above steps for Wordpress

    ![](imgs/ltall.png)
### Step 2.5: TLS Certificates from Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)
- Navigate to AWS ACM
- Under 'Provision certificates' click Get started
- Click Request a certificate
- Enter the domain name you registered (*.\<domain-name>.com), click next
- Select DNS validation and click Next
- Tag the certificate, click Review then confirm and request
- Click Continue
- Click 'Export DNS Configuration file'
- Go to Route 53
- Create a new CNAME record with items from the DNS configuration.csv file downloaded.
- Give a few seconds for validation to complete
  ![](imgs/acm.png)

### Step 2.4: Configure Application Load Balancer (ALB) for Nginx
Nginx instances should only accept connections coming from the ALB and deny any connections directly to it.
- Create an internet facing ALB
  - From the EC2 Console, click Load Balancers. 
  - On the block for Application Load Balancers, click create
  - Enter the name for the load balancer
  - Since it's for the Nginx servers, add a HTTPS Listener
  - Select the VPC you created, check the two AZs and add the public subnets you have. Click next.
  - Select the certificate you created on ACM
    ![](imgs/albacm.png)
  - On the next page, select the ALB security group
  - Configure routing, select the Nginx target group
  - Register targets (unnecessary if you configured your target group correctly)
  - Click Review and complete the process

### Step 2.5: Configure ALB for Webservers
The ALB for the webservers should not be internet facing. And we'll need two ALBs, one for Tooling and Wordpress
- Create an internal ALB
  - From the EC2 Console, click Load Balancers. 
  - On the block for Application Load Balancers, click create
  - Enter the name for the load balancer
  - Select the VPC you created, check the two AZs and add the private subnets you have. Click next.
  - On the next page, select the webserver security group
  - Configure routing, select the Tooling target group
  - Register targets (unnecessary if you configured your target group correctly)
  - Click Review and complete the process
  
    Repeat the above steps for the Wordpress ALB

## Step 3: Setup EFS
- Navigate to EFS from your Management Console
- Click create file system from the right
- Click Customize
- Enter the name for the EFS
- Tag the resource
- Leave everything else and click next
- Select the VPC you created, select the two AZs and choose the private subnets
- Select the EFS security group for each AZ
  ![](imgs/efs-sg.png)
- Click next, next then create

## Step 4: Setup RDS
### Step 4.1: Create a KMS key
- Navigate to AWS KMS
- Click create key
- Make sure it's symmetric
- Give the key an alias
- For 'Define Key admininstrative privileges', select AWSServiceRoleForRDS and OrganizationAccountAccessRole ![](imgs/kms-config.png)
- Select the same thing for Key usage
- Click Finish
  ![](imgs/kms.png)
### Step 4.2: Create a DB Subnet Group
- Navigate to RDS Management Console
- Click the three horizontal lines on the top left
- Select Subnet groups
- Click Create DB subnet group
- Enter the name, description and select your VPC
- Under Add subnets, select the two AZs your data layer subnets are in and select the two private data layer subnets.
- Click Create
  ![](imgs/dbgroup.png)
### Step 4.3: Create RDS Instance
- Navigate to RDS Management Console
- Click Create database
- For Engine options, select MySQL
- For Template, choose Dev/Test
- Enter a name for your DB under DB instance identifier
- Enter Master username and passsword
- Choose the smallest possible instance class (to reduce costs)
- Under Availability, select do not create a standby instance
- Select your VPC, select the subnet group you created and also the data layer security group
- Leave everything else and scroll down to Additional configuration
- Enter initial database name (if you wish, or you could connect to it from your webserver and create required databases)
- Leave everything else, scroll down to Encryption and select the KMS key you created
- Scroll down and click Create database

## Step 5: Tie Everything Together
### Step 5.1: Configure DNS with Route 53
- Create a CNAME record that points www.domain.com to the DNS name of your NGINX load balancer
- Create a CNAME record that points tooling.domain.com to the DNS name of your NGINX load balancer
  ![](imgs/records.png)
### Step 5.2
- Create two config files (one for tooling, one for wordpress) for the nginx load balancer and add to a github repo so you can pull the config during a scale out
- The tooling config file should contain the following settings: 
  ```
  server {
    server_name tooling.domain.com; # company tooling site
    location ~ { # case-sensitive regular expression match
		include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
	    proxy_redirect      off;
	    proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	    proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header    Host $http_host;
		proxy_pass http://tooling-ALB-DNS; # aws-lb
	  }
  }
  ```
  The wordpress config file:
  ```
  server {
    server_name domain.com www.domain.com; # company tooling site
    location ~ { # case-sensitive regular expression match
		include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
	    proxy_redirect      off;
	    proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	    proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header    Host $http_host;
		proxy_pass http://wordpress-ALB-DNS; # aws-lb
	  }
  }
  ```

# Blockers
- I was getting a 502 Bad Gateway error, to solve this, I checked the logs for my nginx instance (I had to SSH into it) and noticed it was returning a permission denied error, so I did:
  ```
  sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
  ```
- To solve 403 errors that may arise from the internal webservers, simply add the above command to the user data script.
- While settting up RDS to connect to Wordpress, I forgot to create a database for Wordpress. Also I couldn't get the webservers to connect to the db, so I executed the following:
  ```
  sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db 1
  ```
- To deploy the applications, I used Ansible to configure tooling servers, manually configured Wordpress, from the Bastion instance.
